This plugin aims to provide easy-to-use, minimal-setup autocompletions for C++
for Sublime Text 3.

# Jump right in! #
Follow all the following steps to ensure the plugin works as expected!

## Install this plugin ##
- Best is to use [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)
  + <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and install
    `EasyClangComplete`
- If you don't have Package Control (you should)
  + download one of the releases from
    [here](https://github.com/niosus/EasyClangComplete/releases).

## Install clang ##
- **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install clang`
- **Other Linux**: use your package manager or install from `clang`
  [website](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html)
- **Windows**: install the latest release from `clang`
  [website](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html)
- **OSX**: ships `clang` by default. You are all set!

## Configure your includes ##
`Clang` will automatically search for headers in the folder that contains the
file you are working on and its parent. If you have a more sophisticated
project you will need to help `clang` just a little bit. There are three ways
to do it. Pick any of the following:

- Set `include_dirs` setting in `User Settings`:
  + see default [settings](EasyClangComplete.sublime-settings) to get started.
    These includes will be included in every project you run.
- Add `.clang_complete` file to the root of your project folder.
  + this file should contain all includes and macroses you want to use.
  + see example [.clang_complete](.clang_complete) file.
  + absolute paths start with `/`. All the others are treated as relative.
- Add all the flags to pass to clang to `*.sublime-project` file.
  + add all settings as a string list under `settings` -> `clang_flags`.
  + See example [sublime-project](easy_clang_complete.sublime-project#L22)
    file.
  + absolute paths start with `/`. All the others are treated as relative.

## Configure completion triggers ##
Add this to your `User Settings`:
```json
"auto_complete_triggers":
[
    {
        "characters": ".:>",
        "selector": "source.c++ - string - comment - constant.numeric"
    }
],
```
It will ensure that Sublime Text will try to autocomplete your code when you
type `.`, `:` or `>`. The plugin will then ensure that completions are
triggered only when `.`, `::` or `->` are typed.
## You're good to go! ##

# More on the plugin #

All the essential information to make the plugin run is written above. If you
are still interested in more details - please read on.

The plugin has two modes:

- one that uses `libclang` with its python bindings. This is the better method
  as it fully utilizes saving compilation database which makes your completions
  blazingly fast. Unfortunately it only works for Linux. Please help me to
  bring it to other platforms if you know more about Windows or OSX than I do.
  There is an issue for Windows opened
  [here](https://github.com/niosus/EasyClangComplete/issues/4).
- `clang -Xclang -code-completion-at` run from the command line. The plugin
  parses the output from a process that runs the above command. This is the
  default method for Windows and OSX. Tested on all platforms (see
  [Testing](#tests) part). Slower than method with `libclang`. Will be
  deprecated when we solve issue #4.

This plugin is intended to be easy to use. It should autocomplete STL out of
the box and you should just add the folders your project uses to `include_dirs`
list in the settings to make it autocomplete code all your project. If you
experience problems - create an issue. I will try to respond as soon as
possible.

## Settings highlights ##
I will only cover most important settings here.

**PLEASE RESTART SUBLIME TEXT AFTER EACH SETTINGS CHANGE**

- `include_dirs`:
    + stores the locations where `clang` should be looking for external
      headers, e.g. `Boost`, `Ros`, `Eigen`, `OpenCV`, etc.
    + you can use placeholders like `$project_base_name` or
      `$project_base_path` to make includes more convenient.
    + it is absolutely ok to include a folder that does not exist. `clang`
      knows how to deal with it and it will neither break anything nor make
      things slower.
- `std_flag`:
    + sets the standard flag that will be used for compilation. Defaults to
      `std=c++11`
- `use_libclang`:
    + if `true` use libclang as backend.
    + if `false` or if first option failed, use output from `clang -Xclang
      -completion-at` command and parse it with regular expressions.
- `search_clang_complete_file`:
    + seach for `.clang_complete` file up the tree. Project folder is the last
      one to search for the file.
    + If the file is found, its contents of style `-I<some_local_path>` and
      `-I/<some_absolute_path>` (mind the `/` at the start of the line) are
      appended to include flags.
- `errors_on_save`:
    + highlight errors on save. A tooltip with an error message will be shown
      if the caret goes over a highlighted line.
- `triggers`:
    + defaults are `".", "::", "->"`. The autocompletion does not trigger on
      `>` or `:`. It also ignores float numbers like `3.14`.
- `use_project_specific_settings`:
    + when `true` will enforce sublime text to read all flags from project
      settings(`*.sublime-project` -> `settings` -> `clang_flags`). This
      settings overrides all other settings like `include_dirs` or `std_flag`
      so should be used with caution. Defaults to `false`. If the project
      settings cannot be found, the plugin will fall back to default behavior.
      An example settings entry looks like this:

      ```json
      "settings":
      {
        "clang_flags":
        ["-std=c++11", "-Isrc", "-I/usr/include",]
      },
      ```

Please see the default settings file in the repo for more settings
descriptions. Every setting in settings
[file](EasyClangComplete.sublime-settings) should have an understandable
comment. Should they not be clear - create an issue.


## Credits ##
The whole work seen here was originally a fork of another repository:
[ClangAutoComplete](https://github.com/pl-ca/ClangAutoComplete)

However, with time this plugin has grown quite different from its origin and
this is why you see it as a separate package now. Anyway, I encourage you to
check out what `ClangAutoComplete` has to offer and come back if you still like
this plugin more.

The trick with multiple `clang.cindex` files is inspired by this repo:
[clangHelper](https://github.com/griebd/clangHelper). Thanks for inspiration!

If you are an experienced python developer and find that something in my code
sucks completely - **DO** tell me. Python is not my main language and I am
always willing to learn.

## Tests ##
I have tried to cover most crucial functionality with unit tests using
[UnitTesting](https://github.com/randy3k/UnitTesting) Sublime Text plugin.
Currently tests cover autocompletion of user struct and stl vector using clang
binary. To check out the current status click on relevant badge below:
